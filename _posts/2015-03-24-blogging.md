Those of you who know me personally or have followed me on twitter for the past few years know I enjoy blogging.  I maintained [UMD Bulldog Country](http://www.umdbulldogcountry.com) for a long time and honestly enjoyed the hell out out of it.  After accepting an oppurtunity to write for SBN College Hockey, I let my awesome blog fade in the distance to share my opinions and statistical findings elsewhere, which is why I created this blog years later.

Although it's safe to assume there won't be very much college hockey posting here, I will be posting my thoughts and opinions on both the Business and Technolgy worlds.

Broad?  Good.

Anyway, here's to hopefully keeping up this blog with my thoughts, opinions, and ramblings!
